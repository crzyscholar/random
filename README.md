# random
this is a repository full of random stuff. you may find anything from malware to cat pictures. I am not responsible if anyone uses anything in this repository for malicious purposes or does any harm. it'd be smart to just assume anything in this repo has malware. calc.exe? that's a malware that pops a calc and connects to c2 exfiltrating all the sensitive information from your device. filedata (28) 1? that's ransomware. K&R pdf? it has a wiper embedded in it. 

I am not liable for anything in this repo.
